A word of advice: Keep up with the work in small installments. Don't leave it all until the last minutes.

Homework Rules
--------------

1.  Attempt each problem yourself. Read each portion of the problem before asking for help. If you don't understand what is being asked, ask for help interpreting the problem and then make an honest attempt to solve it.
2.  Write up each problem independently. You are expected to write the answer in your own words.
3.  Write on your problem set whom you consulted and the sources you used. If you fail to do so, you may be charged with plagiarism and subject to serious penalties.

Assignments
